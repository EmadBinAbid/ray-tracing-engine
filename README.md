# Homework 5: Ray Tracing Engine
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2019

## Purpose

This homework sets the foundation of an extendable ray tracing engine using principles of Object Oriented design. It implements some of the ray tracing topics we have covered, namely:

- tracing a ray through a scene
- sampling a scene
- perspective and parallel projection
- ray-primitive intersections

## Background

For this homework, you must know

- how to read and write object oriented code in C++
- how to compile a C++ project spanning multiple files in multiple directories
- vector arithmetic

## The Problem Set

The problems are defined in `main.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

## Time Requirement

Data unavailable.

## Grading

The marks for this assignment are shown in `rubric.csv`.

## Submission

There are 3 parts to the submission.

### 1. Problem Set

Submit _all_ code files in the `raytracer` folder and its relevant subfolders. `World.cpp` should include an implementation of `World::build` corresponding to your desired scene. Compiling and running `raytracer.cpp` in the `raytracer` folder should generate the corresponding image as `scene.ppm`. You may include other `World::build` implementations in the `build` folder. 

Each problem specifies the names of the files to be submitted for it. Please make sure your submitted files have the indicated names. Any files in your GitHub repository with these names at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. Your submissions will be peer reviewed so please do not include identifying information. Your code will be run by a peer on their machine _as is_ so make sure not to include non-portable files.

_Deadline_: 18h on Monday, 25 November

### 2. Feedback Form

You have to provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the form at [LMS -> Tests & Quizzes](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/WwHsDI). This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

_Deadline_: 18h on Monday, 25 November

### 3. Peer Review

You will review 2 submissions which will be shared with you through [LMS -> Drop Box](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/zMq8bx). The review will be according to the accompanying `rubric.csv` and will be submitted through [LMS -> Assignments](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/x/0UmLTX).

_Deadline_: 18h on Friday, 29 November

## Tips

- Do not include identifying information in your submission.
